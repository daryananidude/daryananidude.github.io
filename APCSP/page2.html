Tesla, Inc. (formerly named Tesla Motors) is an American automaker, energy storage company, and solar panel manufacturer based in Palo Alto, California.[7] Founded in 2003, the company specializes in electric cars, lithium-ion battery energy storage, and, through their SolarCity subsidiary, residential solar panels.[8][9][10][11]

Tesla first gained widespread attention following production of the Roadster, the first mass-produced electric sports car, in February 2008.[12] The company's second vehicle, the Model S, an electric luxury sedan, debuted in June 2012 and is built at the Tesla Factory in California. The Model S has been the world's best-selling plug-in electric car for two years in a row, 2015 and 2016.[13][14] Its global sales achieved the 150,000 unit milestone in November 2016, four years and five months after its introduction.[15] As of December 2016, the Model S ranks as the world's all-time second best-selling plug-in after the Nissan Leaf.[16] The Model S was then followed in September 2015 by the Model X, a crossover SUV. Tesla's fourth vehicle that is designed for the mass-market is the Model 3,[17] which was unveiled in March 2016 and its production started in July 2017 with a base price of US$35,000, before any government incentives.
